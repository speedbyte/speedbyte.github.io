Why are you using manual mode? Do you have a specific reason or has someone told you it's more "professional"? There are often good reasons for using manual, but the photographer's job is to understand when they apply.

Your camera has a very sophisticated automatic metering system. When you point it at a subject, it evaluates the subject and sets the exposure. In "P" mode is sets both aperture and shutter speed. In "A" mode it sets the shutter speed to properly expose the image at a preset aperture. In "S" mode it sets the lens opening to properly expose the image at a preset shutter speed. You can tell the meter to look at the whole scene, the center area of the scene or a small spot. You can lock a predetermined exposure. In "M" mode it totally disregards the meter and uses the lens opening and shutter speed that the photographer dials in.

So when you use manual, you should know that you'll be able to beat the camera's ability to expose properly. And I'm fairly certain that you are not at this point yet.

I have been taking pictures for about 60 years. I learned about exposure when there was no autoexposure and cameras didn't have light meters and you didn't know if you got the exposure right until you looked at a wet negative. So I got pretty good at getting the exposure right. Today, I use autoexposure for everything but external flash and panoramas because it works really well and I know how to use exposure compensation. So I would not recommend using manual exposure for typical photography. It has little benefit and creates many opportunites for failure.

Auto Focus combined with AF Area Mode

OR

Manual Focus mode

you can choose 11 focus points, making it possible to select your main subject anywhere inside the frame.

In Manual focus, it is possible to confirm the subject focus, by rotating the lens until the infocus indicator is displayed. First press the shutter release button half

way and then focus ring.



shorter the focal length, more the optical power ( bending infinite light quickly ) , more the angle of view and lower the magnification -> landscapes
longer the focal length, lesser optical power, angle of view is narrower and higher the magnification -> potraits.

How to find the focal length. Just focus on an infinite object and check when the image would be sharp. Thats the focal length.

The fish lens has got a focal length of 8mm and the standard camera has a focal length of 50 mm. Bevause the fish length has a focal length of 8 mm,
it has a wide angle and can capture 180 degrees. The standard 50 mm focal

Lens - disperses / refracts light - recfraction, dispersion focus
Prism - dispersion

Spherical lens is a part of a sphere - concave or convex

Cylindrical lenses have surfaces with 2 different radii of curvature in 2 orthogonal planes.

Shutter speed - 1/125 second ( 8 seconds to 1/1200 )
Aperture - f/11 ( 1 second to 500 )
Exposure - f/2.8 to f/16 ( depth of field )

minimum focusing distance - 0.4 m to 1 m


==== Raytracing ====

 Difference between ray tracing and beam tracing:
 Rays have no thickness, but beams are shaped as unbounded pyramids with polygonal cross sections. The idea is since
 1984.
 Primarily two things: Ray tracing and scan line tracing.
 Ray tracing is a very complex algorithm, but in short there are


==== OpenGL ====

Conclusion

    OpenGL is an API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics.
    OpenGL-ES is a subset of OpenGL targeting embedded systems.

    WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics, based on OpenGL-ES.

    GLU is a utility library for OpenGL, which mainly contains mapping functions.
    GLEW is a utility library for OpenGL, which can handle loading of OpenGL Extensions.
    GLUT & SDL is a library for handling various things like window, keyboard and mouse control as well as listening.
    QT is a framework mainly for creating GUI.

Thereby GLU, GLEW, GLUT is simply utility libraries for OpenGL, which requires OpenGL, if not they aren't for much good.

SDL doesn't require OpenGL and isn't directly an OpenGL utility library mainly, but it can be used with OpenGL but also with other things as well.
