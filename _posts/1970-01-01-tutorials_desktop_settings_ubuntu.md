I could find dark themes for almost all my applications and I would list them here, how I did it:

Firefox : Dark Background and Light Text Add on.  Additionally, one needs a Theme and I installed Breeze Dark also from the Addons Menu. There is also an interesting Addon to quickly change themes and its called ThemesMenu.

Thunderbird: same as above, because both are from Mozilla.

Eclipse Color Theme Update Site :  ColorTheme - http://eclipse-color-theme.github.io/update/ and then choose SublimeText2

Latexilla and gedit: Cobalt Blue based Color Scheme. Almost all the gnome applications color schemes can be set under Preferences.

Tweak-Tool:

Global Dark Theme is set to True, Window is set to Adwaita, GTK+ is set to Radiance, Icons are set to DMZ-Black, Cursor is set to Oxy-Zion.
