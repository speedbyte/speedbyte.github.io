 Concurrent  processes are processes that can be stopped in between, so that an  other process can be run. Once the
 process is finished, the first  process takes over. It is a kind of scheduling. Parallelization
 is done  on multiple cores i.e processes that have no dependancies on each other  are run on parallel cores. The
 difference between concurrent processes  and parallel is that the parallel processes run at the
 same instant of  time and the concurrent processes run at the same period.
