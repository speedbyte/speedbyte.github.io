Flow of charges:

Current is the movement of charges. The charges ( electrons ) are forced to separate from its nucleus by an external exerting force such as a magnetic field or a battery. The current is a scalar quantity, that means, even if we bend the wire where the current is flowing the net current does not change. To understand this, we can take an example of a vector quantity like Force and then exert a force on a metal rod in one direction. Ofcourse when we bend the rod now, the force that comes out of the end of the rod changes. 

If now force is exerted on the electrons, the net charge of the material remains the same i.e the number of electrons and protons ( in the nucleus ) is the same. Hence we do not feel any current when we touch any material that consists of electrons ( all materials have electrons ). Even if the charges are flowing for example a flowing water, the net charge always remains the same. However, when a battery is connected, then the battery induces a force and forces the electrons to move. This force is exerted on our body, in case we touch that wire and the electrons escape from the wire through our body into the large sink ( earth ). This means, that the material has lesser electron than it had in the beginning. This is true and to maintain the equilibrium, the battery supplies the excess electrons and this is how a battery is discharged.

Well, then what if the electrons are not escaping. The electrons always escape in terms of other form of energy, for example heat energy ( in case of light bulbs ). The lost electrons needs to be replaced by an external element like current from a battery or from the mains.

The direction of flow of electrons is acutally the direction of flow of protons. Its just for historical reasons, we still use the same direction.  The movement of the electrons inside the material is an interesting phenomena. The electrons move inside the materials randomly at a speed of 10^5 m/s. Hence the net movement is 0. However when an electrical field is applied, the electrons are still randomly moving with the speed of 10^6 m/s, but along that there is a drift speed of around 10^-5 m/s. This drift speed induces a movement of electrical charges and hence current.

There is a common misconception of Ohms Law, that the formula V=IR belongs to Ohms Law. The Ohms Law, states that the relation between Voltage and Current is linear. This is a valid statement for resistances at a particular temperature, but is invalid for components such as diodes and transistors. The Ohms Law is not valid for such components, because the relation between Voltage and current is not linear. 

It is interesting to know, why the Ohms Law is valid for some materials like metals. The reason is that the mean time between collisions between the electrons and the atoms of the metal is a constant. The mean time between collisions is the time between the collision and start of the random journey of that electron. The energy acquired from each electron during this mean free time is different from different electrons, but in totality the drift due to the electrical field remains constant. The motion of the random movement of the electrons are governed by quantam physics and the speed of the electrons in the random movement is called Maxwellian speed. The resistance of a material depends on the area, length and the resistivity ( electrical field  / current density )  of  the material. If we can prove  ( not only observation ) that the resistivity is a constant for such materials, then we can prove that the resistance of material is also constant. In quantam physics, the resistivity depends on mass of the electron, charge of the electrons, number of carriers per unit volume, and the mean free time between collisions. It looks like that the mean free time is the only variable, and hence it has been observed that the mean free time remains constant irrespective of the temperature and the electrical field applied. Hence, the overall resistivity of the material is a constant at a given temperature and hence overall resistance is constant.

The electron flows because it is possible to free the electron from their orbit. In an insulator, the electrons are tightly coupled to the nucleus and in conductors, they are loosely coupled. The semiconductors lie somewhere in between. These numbers can be found out by the resistivity of the substance. The insulators have a very high resistivity, the conductors very low and the semiconductors somewhere in between. Ofcourse to free the electrons, one needs some energy and this energy is the energy from either the electrical field or by increasing the temperature of the substance. The potential energy of the electrons depends on the electrical field. The kinetic energy of the electrons depends on the random velocity, that is a fixed component. This is this potential energy that is converted into either heat energy ( toaster ) or kinetic energy ( motors ). One can think of potential energy as the height of a waterfall and the stones as electrons. The amount of energy the stone / electron has depends on the height of the waterfall / potential difference. 

The electrical field is Volts / meter, just like current density is Current / Area. The potential difference is a scalar quantity deciding how much energy in total can be supplied. Electrical field is more that how much energy can pass through a particular unit and which direction. Similarly, Power is the rate of transfer of energy. Some cars are more powerful, because they can quickly supply a lot of energy and hence energy per time is high. Another cars, although possessing the same energy, cannot transfer the energy so quickly from one form to another and hence are deemed less powerful.


There must be some major difference between metals and semiconductors, because the semiconductors have made advanced progress in electronic industry. Two major differences are 1. the semiconductors like silicon can be doped with carriers and thus the electrical property of the material can be controlled. 2. the temperature coefficient of resistivity is negative i.e the resisitivity decreases as temperature increases.  A typical comparison of insulators, conductors, semiconductors and superconductors.

Ammeters and Voltmeters and Ohmmeter are measuring instruments to measure current, voltage and resistances. Ohmmeters and ohm-meter are two different things. The former is a measuring instrument and the later is the unit of resistivity. One important point in a measuring instrument is that the measuring instrument as such should not create any kind of disturbance in the overall circuit. For example, to measure the current, if the resistance of the ammeter is a considerable value, then the overall current would be affected. Hence ammeters with negligible resistance is used and the potential drop across the resistance is measured to give an idea about the current flow through that path. Similarly, the voltmeter should have a high impedance, so that the measuring circuit overall resistance is not being affected.

====== Electrical Fields ======


A charged plastic rod produces a vector field called an electrical field. The electrical field is defined by the electrical force acting on a unit charged particle in that direction. It is the ratio of the electrical force and the unit charged particle and the direction of the electrical field is the same as the direction of the electrical force. 

====== Magnetic Fields ======

An electrical charge is an electrical monopole, but unfortunately, no magnetic monopole has been discovered yet, and hence a similiar equation ( Electrical field is a ration of electrical force on a unit charge ) for the magnetic field cannot be given.
The magnetic field can be set up by two ways. 1. Some of the elements have intrinsic magnetic characteristics such as magnets. As all electrons have charges and mass, it also has an intrinsic magnetic field around it. In some materials such as magnets, the magnetic field adds up producing a net magnetic field and in some other materials such as our body, the magnetic field sums up to produce a net magnetic field of 0. 2. The second way to produce a magnetic field are moving charges. The magnet / or a moving electrical charge hence sets up magnetic field B.


Both electrical field and magnetic field can live individually on static points, but for moving charges cannot live without each other, This is because a moving charge's electrical fields induces a magnetic field in the orthogonal direction.

Measure Electrical Field and Magnetic Field.

The electrical field can be determined by putting a test particle of charge q at rest and measuring the electrical force F acting on the particle.  The formula is E = F / q.

Unfortunately, there is nothing called a test particle of magnetic monopole ( similar to an electron ), hence the magnetic field can only be determined by measuring the magnetic force ( orthogonal to electrical force ) exerted on a moving electrically charged test particle. In principle, we do this by firing a charged particle through the point at which the magnetic field has to be determined, using various directions and speeds for the particle and determining the force F that acts on the particle at that point. The observation then gives us a formula i.e the formula is not deduced, but is a result of an observation. So just remember it by heart !


====== Effect of external magnetic field on moving charges: ======

Experimentally, we find that when a charged particle ( either alone or as a current ) moves through a magnetic field, a force due to the field can act on the particle. And there is a relationship between the magnetic field and this force.

No force due to a magnetic field is exerted on non moving electrical charge. See the forumlaThe formula is B = F / qv ( where q is the charge of the particle ) . Or Force is the cross product of magnetic field and the velocity. The cross product is a vector governed by the right hand rule. The index finger is the first term in the cross product, the middle finder the second term and the thumb is the cross product of the two. In the case of magnetic force and magnetic field, the cross product is F = q(v * B). The magnitude of the cross product is qvBsinø and the direction is orthogonal to both the direction of velocity and the magnetic field. Ofcourse, here we wanted to calculate the magnetic field. Hence, by observing the pressure, we can determine the magnetic field at that point. The SI unit for magnetic field is Newton per couloumb per meter / s also called as Tesla or Gauss. 

 * Neutronstar - 10^8 T
 * Bar magnet - 10^-2 T
 * Field near the earths surface - 10^-4 T

Experiments:

Gamma ray knocking an electron out of hydrogen atom produces two charged particles - electron and positron.
JJ Thompson Cathode Ray Tube experiment for orthogonal electrical field ad magnetic field.


Crossed Fields. 

Both an electrial field and a magnetic field can produce a force on a charged particle. When the two fields are perpendicular to each other, they are said to be crossed fields. 

====== Hall Effect ======

The beam of electrons can be deflected by a magnetic field. Does the same principle apply in a current carrying copper wire? The answer is in the Hall effect, where it can determine, if the medium carrying the charges are positive or negative. And also, it is possible to determine how many carriers per unit volume is present. In Hall effect, the electrical force build by the separation of the charges cancel out exactly the external magnetic field force. Hence the current keeps on flowing as if nothing happenned. A kind of tunnel is created. The Hall effect also proves, that the charges flowing / moving inside the conductors are indeed negative.


Hall effect says that the 

current loop in a magnetic field generates torque on the current loop. -> Motors

Faradays law of induction says that

Similarly, if tourque is applied on a loop in a magnetic field then it would generate current. -> Generators

Work done, per unit charge is called induced emf.

The actual number of fixed lines passing through the conducting loop does not matter. The values of the induced emf and induced current are determined by the rate at which the field changes. In other words, the magnitude of the induced emf is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux. This change in magnetic flux can be achieved by 

flux generated by an external magnetic field

 * change the magnetic field intensitiy
 * change the area of the coil within the magnetic field
 * change the angle between the magnetic field and plane of the coil

flux generated by flowing current

 * change the current flowing within the coil - alternating current

====== Lenzs Law ======

According the Lenz, law any kind of induced emf would act opposite to the force that is leading to the induction. Hence if the change in magnetic flux is leading to an induced emf, then the direction of the induced emf would be such that it would oppose the change in the magnetic flux. 

Capacitor produces desired electrical field and inductor produces a desired magnetic field.

Gauss, Weber, Tesla, Hall, Faraday, Lenz, Henry


LC Oscillators produce oscillations at a certain frequency. The magnetic oscillations is then induced in another coil that induces emf and hence produces current with the same oscillation. The corresponding oscillations can be sent as radio waves using an electric dipole antenna. This antenna is like a conducting rod. As the oscillation strikes the rod, the charges in rod oscillate too with the same frequency and radiate the energy outward at the speed of light.

====== Miscallenous ======

Lenzs law : Change in flux induces electrical current. The electrical current directin is such that the induced magnetic field due to the change in electrical field will oppose the change in flux which induced the electrical current.


Change in magnetic flux induces electrical current - Faradays law


Earth magnetic field : 25000 to 40000 nT
Refrigerator : 10,000,000 nT
1 Testla is a very large field.
Magnetic fields occur whenever charge is in motion. As more charge is put in more motion, the strength of a magnetic field increases.
Elecctromagnetic Force is the change in flux over time. This is also synomonously called the voltage. Faradays law tells the magnitude of the electromagnetic force, lenzs laws tells the direcion of the EMF.


Faradays law is the  main principle behind the electrical generator. Permanent magnet, coil rotation, brush to take out the voltage. Sometimes its a brushless motor. the brushless motor employs halls effect.


4 Fundamental forces of the universe:
Gravity - is the weakest of all the force
Weak interaction : 10 to the power of 25 times the gravity, but is only feasible in the atomic level. 
Electromagnetic force:  10 to the powr of 26 times the gravity. Large concentration or charges are missing. Because there is a neutral environment. Electrostatic forces / couloumb force is the force between the two charges. Electromagnetic force and electrostatic forces are the same force but viewed from the different views of reference.


Strong force:  10 to the powre of 28 times Gravity. The protons are forced to combine together inspite of same charges are due to the strong forces.
Stationary charges have no magnetic field. Only moving chages have magnetic fields.
Faradays, Lenz, Maxwell, Lorenz
Maxwell equation:
One important consequence of the equations is that they demonstrate how fluctuating electric and magnetic fields propagate at the speed of light. Known as electromagnetic radiation, these waves may occur at various wavelengths to produce a spectrum from radio waves to γ-rays.


Lorenz FORCE:
A particle of charge q moving with velocity v in the presence of an electric field E and a magnetic field B experiences a force


Hall effect sensor: 
Varies its output voltage in response to the magnetic field. This way the voltage can give an indication of the amount of magnetic field the magnet has induced. The principle is that the beam will be deflected when there is a presence of a magnetic field. Because of the deflection an electrical field is created and the force experienced by the new electrical field works against the magnetic field force. At the point both of them cancel each other and the electron beam continue to travel straight, thats the point where we can calculate the magnetic flux density of the magnet. The voltage between the two ends is called the hall voltage.
provides a constant driving current to the sensors
amplifies the output voltage.

====== Light ======

Fresnel approximation.
Frequency hopping spread spectrum
Direct Sequence Spread spectrum
Reflection of a wave has no effect in frequency hopping because by the time the reflected wave reaches the antenna, the frequency is changed.
Higher the bandwidth more the data rate. This can be proved by differentiating the light equation with respect to wavelength.
Fibre optics run in Ultra Violet spectrum ( 1.3 micro meter ) wavelenth. Normally, the length of the wavelength for FM radio waves is in the order of meters. 
As a rule of thumb, - 100 Mhz is 3 meters. 1 Ghz is 30 cm

The properties of radio waves: At lower frequencies radio waves pass through obstacles well, but the power falls off sharply with distance from the source ( square inverse ) way.
At high frequencies, radio waves tend ot travel in straight lines and bounce off obstacles. They are also absorbed by rain. At all fequencies, radio waves are subject to interference
from motors and other electrical equipments.
Hence higher the frequency, lower the penetration power. The radio waves 100 Mhz etc can easily penetrate buildings / glass etc and hence portable radio can be used inside the apartment.

Ionosphere reflects the high frequency signals, because they cannot be transmitted through ground atmosphere for longer distance. 

At higher frequency the waves can travel in straight line and can be narrowly focussed.  Hence, the satellite dishes must be accurately aligned to the GSLV satellites.
Multipath fading.
Transmission is dependant on the weather.  Hence at a particular weather condition, if a particular frequency is completely
wiped off, then the operators switch to a different frequency to start communicating. Hence a band of frequencies
are provided.
For example, 4 GHz waves are completely absorbed by water.
Higher the frequency, more the electron volt and hence gamma rays has immense eV and radio waves is 10^20 times weaker !

The power is regulated. some bands such as bluetooth are only allowed to have a maximum power so that the waves do not travel far away
and interfere with some other garage door for example.
Mobile communicaiton on the other  hand need a high power and hence must be tightly controlled by the government.

As we go more away from long radio wave towards visible light, the waves behave more like light and less and less like radio. 
Radios can penetrate, but lights cannot penertrate. Radio are omnidirectional, but lights are pretty much straight and focussed.
