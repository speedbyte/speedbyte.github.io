Description: X.Org X server -- Nouveau display driver
This driver for the X.Org X server (see xserver-xorg for a further description) provides support for NVIDIA Riva, TNT, GeForce, and Quadro cards.
This package provides 2D support including EXA acceleration, Xv and RandR.  3D functionality is provided by the libgl1-mesa-dri package. This package is built from the FreeDesktop.org xf86-video-nouveau driver.

Description: X.Org X server -- VESA display driver
This driver for the X.Org X server (see xserver-xorg for a further description) uses the standard VESA interface provided on all video cards, but runs unaccelerated.  This driver is not recommended for use unless you have a problem with the normal driver for your card, because it will perform very badly.

download the graphics from the NVIDIA website
it is assumed that the download is stored in Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-aaa.bbb.run
install the driver
sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm stop
sh Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-aaa.bbb.run
follow instructions of driver installation package
sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm start
Alternative method over GRUB
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
add nomodeset into GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=”quiet splash nomodeset”
sudo update-grub
restart.
Install Nvidia graphic driver
sudo sh Nvidia**.run
sudo /etc/init.d/kdm stop (or start)

For video generation via VTD you may also have to install the mencoder package ( mplayer is a part of this package ) and depending packages. Movie encoder encodes from one format to another.
UEFI replaces BIOS
GPT replaces MBR
/etc/X11/xorg.conf should have the Device0 as nvidia.

Support timeframes for Unix legacy GPU releases:
https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3142

## What we're working on right now:

- Normal driver updates
- Help Wanted: Mesa Updates for Intel/AMD users, ping us if you want to help do this work, we're shorthanded.

## WARNINGS:

This PPA is currently in testing, you should be experienced with packaging before you dive in here:

Volunteers welcome!

### How you can help:

## Install PTS and benchmark your gear:

    sudo apt-get install phoronix-test-suite

Run the benchmark:

    phoronix-test-suite default-benchmark openarena xonotic tesseract gputest unigine-valley

and then say yes when it asks you to submit your results to openbechmarking.org. Then grab a cup of coffee, it takes a bit for the benchmarks to run. Depending on the version of Ubuntu you're using it might preferable for you to grabs PTS from upstream directly: http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/?k=downloads

## Share your results with the community:

Post a link to your results (or any other feedback to): https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers-testers

Remember to rerun and resubmit the benchmarks after driver upgrades, this will allow us to gather a bunch of data on performance that we can share with everybody.

If you run into old documentation referring to other PPAs, you can help us by consolidating references to this PPA.

If someone wants to go ahead and start prototyping on `software-properties-gtk` on what the GUI should look like, please start hacking!

## Help us Help You!

We use the donation funds to get the developers hardware to test and upload these drivers, please consider donating to the "community" slider on the donation page if you're loving this PPA:
