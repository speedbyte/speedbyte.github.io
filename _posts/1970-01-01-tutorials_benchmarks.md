====== Dhrystone ======

Dhrystone is a general-performance benchmark test originally developed by Reinhold Weicker in 1984. This benchmark is used to measure and compare the performance of different computers or, in this case, the efficiency of the code generated for the same computer by different compilers. The test reports general performance in Dhrystone per second.

Like most benchmark programs, Dhrystone consists of standard code and concentrates on string handling. It uses no floating-point operations. It is heavily influenced by hardware and software design, compiler and linker options, code optimizing, cache memory, wait states, and integer data types.

Whetstone Benchmarks

Whetstone is a benchmark test which attempts to measure the speed and efficiency at which a computer performs floating-point operations. The result of the test is given in units called kilo-whetstones-per-second or KWIPS.

The Whetstone is a synthetic benchmark designed to measure the behavior of scientific programs. It contains several modules that are meant to represent a mix of operations typically performed in scientific applications. A wide variety of C functions including sin, cos, sqrt, exp, and log are used as well as integer and floating-point math operations, array accesses, conditional branches, and procedure calls. The primary aim of this benchmark is to measure the performance of both integer and floating-point arithmetic.
