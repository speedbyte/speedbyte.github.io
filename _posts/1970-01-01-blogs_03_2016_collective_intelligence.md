Can we say that the collective intelligence in the web world, where google, netflix, amazon etc. are using data from the customers to improve their algorithms is a stepping stone for the multi sensor fusion algorithms. Can the algorithms from these areas used in automotive or robotics world in making a better decision i.e where should a car travel to in the next junction?

The reach and researches in automatic cars has got no ends. One implementation leads an opening ground to other researches.
