====== ABSTRACT ======

WeatherNeffects is a high performance software library for RADAR raytracing computing with an easy-to-use API. The software interfaces with robotic simulations such as VIRES, and takes extensive benefits of parallel computing on CUDA or OpenCL based devices making the execution of the code platform independant and highly portable. The software interfaces perfectly with OpenSceneGraph and OpenDrive ( a xml based protocol to trigger the scene dynamics ). In the process of work, a set of standard APIs are defined for compatibility with different vendors.
