Primitives are place holders like points, lines and planes. Axioms define these points, lines and planes. For example given any two points only one line passes through them. It is hence a defintion of the axioms. The different defintions leads to different geometrical relations. Axioms are assumed true and not proven. That a line is incident  ( only one line passing throught two points )

From the given set of axioms, synthesis proceeds as carefully constructed logical arguements. When a significant result is proved rigorously, it becomes a theorem. For example pythagoras theorem. The hypotenuse is the square of the sum of two lines at 90 degrees to each other that make the triangle. This is a theorem and has hence a logical statement, that was tested and rigorously proved. 

Euclid space is one kind of implementation of the axioms. A sine curve with grid on is cartesian coordinate system on a euclidean space. If there were no grid, then it would be a simple euclidean space, because the points ( system ) is not yet defined. Similarly the same sine curve with grid on can be represented in a spherical coordinate system.


Euclidean geometry is the study of geometry that satisfies all of Euclid's axioms, including the parallel postulate. One such axiom called parallel postulate ( there are 5 postulates in euclidean geometry ), 

If a line segment intersects two straight lines forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two right angles, then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.
This postulate does not specifically talk about parallel lines,[1] it is only a postulate related to parallelism
