Median is the position
Mean is the value

Standard deviation is the square root of sample variance. The variance has a square because it is actually a sum of square of differences between the value and the mean, divided by the total 
samples. Unbiased estimate ( n-1 ) of the variance. Biased estimate of the vairance. Standard deviation is unlinear because of the square root.

The samples are further away from the mean with a higher standard deviation.
Bionomial Distribution gives an idea of the standard deviation and the mean.  If the peak of the bell curve is in the middle, then the probability of the occurence of the random variable is in the middle.
If the peak deviates from the middle, then the probability of the occurence of the random variable tends to be not equal, but is favored either to the lower or the higher side.

So, while calculating the standard deviations, the samples are the probability of occurences of the random variable  ( for example no occurence to occurence every time in for exanmple 10 throws of a basketball  ) 
Expected value is the mean value.
Covariance between two variables is the variance between the two random variables. If the covariance is negative, it means the two random variables are digressing from their means in the opposite direction. If the value is positive, then the two random variables are on the same side of the mean.. either both the random variables are less than the mean, or both the random variables are more than the expected value.
