Robert Ludlum                                                      Tristine and illâ€¦
April, 2006Review :
A book about the tactics used by the allied powers to make Germany attack Russia. Russia and Germany were in a peace pact of non aggression and hence were working on its own. Where Russia was annexing Poland, Bolivia and other 17 sister countries,Germany was occupying France, Denmark, Spain, etc. In August 1941, Germany had attacked Paris in 2 months taken control of Paris. Daniel Eigen, a US spy working for a group and assigned the mission to make Germany attack Russia by providing false information, actual name is Stephen Metcalfe and he is in love with a beautiful Russian ballerina. She performs in a opera kind of thing which is pretty famous in Russia ( Moscow ) . The Lubyanka prison is the place where all the people are executed. Stalin, the dictator who was a communist and wanted the whole world to be communist had executed 35000 military soldiers thinking they were against them. He was barbaric and had led Russia into dooms. In those days, Russia was nothing. It had no money, but had enough power. The people were hungry and there was not enough sanitation. Living conditions were also vey poor. France, Germany on the other hand had higher living standards.
With high manoevering skills and evading NYVK ( a russian agency ), KGB, this spy was able to reach his goal through the Russian dancer, Lana.
The book is really stupid in the end, with the aim of just increasing thenumber of pages. Some scences are way to exaggerated, like the fight between Kleist , Stephen and Colan in the pseudo city of Berlin.  Also, Lanas son was not a surprise, as it was meant to be for readers till the end. It was pretty obvious, and so the ending was very poor.

Review
A book about the differences between Science and Religion. Galileo, Copernicus are ppl from 1600, 17 th century and they form Illuminati ( Church of Illumination ) and the base is in Rome. Vatican City is the center of all Christianity with lots of churches and chapels here and there. The Illuminati has a certain code of direction following which one could lead to the place where the secret meeting takes place. Robert Langdon, after receiving a call from the director of CERN ( a very famous scientific research center in Switzerland ) started researching on the murder of a famous scientist. This scientist had developed antimatter which is a highly volatile substance and a gram has a power equivalent to the bomb dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But since it is antimatter, it explodes as soon as it comes in contact with matter. This antimatter production was made the basis of the Big bang theory and that our earth was born from the explosion of nothing. And that explosion was the hand of God. Science and religion has always fought against each other and hence Church has never let things which could be scientifically correct to come up. Logic always looks correct because our brain is made in such a way which accepts anything logical automatically. But as we know, intelligence is the opposite of hapinness, the very sense of miracles and fantasies are away and we live a life of robots. Maxmilan, Vetra, are other characters.
Also interesing is how, the selection of Pope takes place. The white smoke indicationg that the decision is made. Priests from all over the world come and participate in total of 160 and decide their new pope openly. They are not allowed to go out until the selection is finalised.
